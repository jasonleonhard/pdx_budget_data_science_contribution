### pdx_budget_data_science_contribution

In conjunction with [Hack Oregon](http://www.hackoregon.org/) and [Hack University](http://www.hackoregon.org/hack-university/) I have elected to assist in preparing the city of Portland, Oregon's Budget analysis for the fiscal year of 2016. This is part of a larger community-powered non-profit building open data project to promote engagement, awareness, and quality of life.

Transforming public information into public knowledge through data-inspired projects I will dive deep into complex and nuanced data sets with the goal of building high-quality web products for public interest. The work in this repository will then be utilized by the organization group projects, such as a dynamic visualization project involving in-state campaign finance data for the 2016 election year.

As a technical group, we are especially interested in data visualization, machine learning, predictive analysis, and questions of UX design surrounding data-presentation. We incorporate visual thinking approaches to our work sessions and highly encourage collaboration from the visual art, design, and political communities.
